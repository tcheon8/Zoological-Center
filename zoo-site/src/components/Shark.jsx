          A group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of 
          the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade 
          Selachimorpha and are the sister group to the Batoidea. Some sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category 
          including extinct members of Chondrichthyes with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Sharks range in size from 
          the small dwarf lanternshark, a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres in length, to 
          the whale shark, the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres in length.
          <br />
          <br />
          They are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres. They generally do not live in 
          freshwater, although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be found in
          both seawater and freshwater.Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites 
          in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. Since 
          1970, shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.

          <br />
          <li>When a shark loses a tooth, another one will quickly take its place to ensure that these apex 
              predators are always prepared for their next meal.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Sharks are one of the rare animals that, depending on the species, can give live birth, lay eggs, 
              or a combination of both.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Shark skin feels similar to sand paper.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Based on fossil scales found in Australia and the United States, scientists hypothesize sharks first appeared in the ocean 
              aroung 455 million years ago.</li>
