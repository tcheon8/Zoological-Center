          Parrots are birds with a strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet. They are conformed by four families that 
          contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families 
          are the Psittaculidae, Psittacidae, Cacatuoidea, and Strigopidae. One-third of all parrot species are threatened 
          by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk than any other comparable bird group.Parrots have a 
          generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions as well.

          They—along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies—are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species 
          to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of 
          length; many are vividly coloured and some, multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the 
          visual spectrum.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>1. Parrots have long life spans. Generally speaking, the larger parrot species live longer, some as 
                 long as many humans.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>2. Some parrot feathers contain a pigment that's bacteria-resistan and prevents feathers from damage 
                 caused by them.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>3. A parrot group is called a pandemonium.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>4. Parrots are highly social and usually live in flocks. They communicate with each other using loud calls 
                 and display complex behaviors within their group.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>5. Most parrots eat a diet that includes nuts, seeds, fruit, and nectar, but some will also eat 
                 insects and small animals.</h3>
