        <h3>
          Hawks are birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. These birds of prey have captured the imagination 
          of humans for centuries with their impressive hunting skills and majestic appearance. With their keen
          eyesight, powerful wings, and sharp talons, hawks have adapted perfectly to their environment, making 
          them efficient hunters and masters of the skies.
          <br />
          <br />
          The great majority of hawks are more useful to humans than they are harmful, but there is still widespread 
          prejudice against them. Occasionally these birds of prey attack poultry and smaller birds, but usually they 
          eat small mammals, reptiles, and insects. Hawks have many foraging techniques, but the most typical in their 
          pursuit of prey is raking, or swiftly following the animal's efforts to escape. Once the hawk has secured 
          the prey with its powerful talons, the bird dismembers it with its sharply pointed strong beak.

          <br />
