          Hawks are birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. These birds of prey have captured the imagination 
          of humans for centuries with their impressive hunting skills and majestic appearance. With their keen
          eyesight, powerful wings, and sharp talons, hawks have adapted perfectly to their environment, making 
          them efficient hunters and masters of the skies.
          <br />
          <br />
          The great majority of hawks are more useful to humans than they are harmful, but there is still widespread 
          prejudice against them. Occasionally these birds of prey attack poultry and smaller birds, but usually they 
          eat small mammals, reptiles, and insects. Hawks have many foraging techniques, but the most typical in their 
          pursuit of prey is raking, or swiftly following the animal's efforts to escape. Once the hawk has secured 
          the prey with its powerful talons, the bird dismembers it with its sharply pointed strong beak.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>1. Some hawks can attain speeds of over 150 mph when diving.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>2. In many animal species the males are larger and stronger, but 
                 in hawks the difference in size between the sexes is reversed, and females are larger.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>3. Large hawks lay only one or two eggs each year, small hawks from three to five. Incubation 
                 takes three to six weeks, depending on the species.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>4. All hawks are protected by state and federal laws. It is illegal to capture or kill a hawk, or
                 to possess a hawk, alive or dead, without the proper permits.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>5. Most hawks pair for life, but if one partner dies, the other will quickly find a new mate.</h3>
