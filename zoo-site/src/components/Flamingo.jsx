           Flamingos are a type of wading birds in the family Phoenicopteridae, which is the only extant family 
           in the order Phoenicopteriformes. There are five species, or types, of flamingo,tThe most common type 
           is the lesser flamingo. It is found mainly in eastern and southern Africa and India. Other types of 
           flamingo come from Central and South America, Caribbean islands, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle
           East, and southern Asia. 
          <br />
          <br />
           They are also highly gregarious birds, flocks numbering in the hundreds may be seen in long, curving 
           flight formations and in wading groups along the shore. On some of East Africa's large lakes, more 
           than a million lesser flamingos gather during the breeding season. In flight, flamingos present a striking 
           and beautiful sight, with legs and neck stretched out straight, looking like white and rosy crosses with 
           black arms. No less interesting is the flock at rest, with their long necks twisted or coiled upon the 
           body in any conceivable position.
