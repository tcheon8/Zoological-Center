        <h3>
          African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's 
          zebra, the plains zebra, and the mountain zebra. Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the 
          three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, 
          unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, 
          with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and 
          southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, 
          grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.

          Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions, 
          and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with 
          plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult 
          females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In 
          harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish 
          territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body 
          postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
        <ul>
          <li>A typical zebra can be 3.5 to 5 ft tall.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Zebras become completely mature from three to six years.</li>
          <br />
          <li>At night, zebras usually lie down while sleeping, but during 
              the daytime, they habitually sleep standing up.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The stripes of zebras control their temperature. The white stripes 
              reflect heat while the black stripes absorb heat.</li>
          <br />
          <li>They have a good memory, zebras use their memory location to know 
              if the place is best for them to live.</li>
