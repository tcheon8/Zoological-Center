          Lionfish are a group of fish known for their maroon, white or black stripes, intricate fins, and venomous spiky
          extensions. They have also been called turkeyfish, firefish and tastyfish. They inhabit coral reefs of the Pacific Ocean,
          as well as the Indian Ocean, and are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments that vary in temperature and depth.
          Lionfishes are easily recognizable by their bars, tall dorsal fin spines, and enormous pectoral fins. They belong to the 
          family Scorpaenidae, a well-known family consisting of the scorpionfishes and the rockfishes. Collectively, the lionfishes 
          consist of five genera and are all allocated to the subfamily Pteroinae.

          Lionfishes come in a range of sizes, from the small twospot turkeyfish to the larger red lionfish at about 1 foot. The 
          record red lionfish caught measured 18.5 inches total length. In addition to their value for the ornamental hobby, lionfishes
          are popular as food in some parts of the world. Their popularity as a food item in the Americas is increasing rapidly. Lionfish 
          can now be found served from small beachside shacks to high-end, luxurious restaurants.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
        <ul>
          <li>The 13 long fins that extend from the spine of the lionfish are venomous and used to deter predators.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Lionfish have been documented to hunt over 50 species of fish. They will corner prey and strike, engulfing their meals 
              in a swift bite.</li>
          <br />
          <li>A lionfish's stomach can expand up to 30 times its regular size. Gobies, snappers, and groupers are some of its favorites.</li>
          <br />
          <li>In the wild, lionfish can survive for up to 15 years. After hatching, they take approximately 18 months to reach full maturity.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Few dare to attack lionfish for fear of being pierced by their thorny fins. Research suggests some fish would rather go without 
              any food than eat a lionfish.</li>
