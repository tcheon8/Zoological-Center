          A large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal
          and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa
          camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight
          extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological
          measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
          <br />
          <br />
          The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like
          ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its
          closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa
          in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and
          woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species,
          which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>1. Males can grow up to 18 feet and females can reach 14 feet in height.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>2. Giraffes are browsers, taking leavess and shoots of Acacia and other trees and 
                 shrubs. The only competition they have for food is the elephant.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>3. While they may eat a lot, giraffes don't drink much water. This is because they get 
                 most of their water from their leafy meals, and only need to drink once every few days.
            </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>4. In the wild, they can live for around 25 years. In captivity they live longer, and 
                 have been known to reach 40 years old.</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>5. Giraffe feet are the size of a dinner plate with a diameter of 30 cm.</h3>
