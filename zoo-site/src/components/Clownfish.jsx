        <h3>
          Clownfish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species 
          of Clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion. In
          the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species, Clownfish are overall
          yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a length 
          of 17 cm, while the smallest barely achieve 7-8 cm.

          <br />
          In the wild, a Clownfish needs the protection it finds in an anemone. The anemone's stings keep fish predators at 
          bay, and a clownfish never lives without its host anemone. The partnership may benefit the anemone as well — it gets 
          scraps of food dropped by the clownfish as it eats. And the aggressive and territorial clownfish may defend its anemone
          by driving away butterflyfishes and other anemone-eating fishes.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Clownfish communicate by making popping and clicking noises.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Male clownfish are the primary caretakers for their young, with females only helping on occasion.</li>
          <br />
          <li>All clownfish start life as a male. As it grows, a male may change to become a female.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Before a clownfish can call an anemone home, it has to get comfortable. The fish gently touches the anemone's 
              tentacles for several hours or days, until the fish forms a layer of mucus that protects it from the stings.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Clownfish make up over 40% of the global marine ornamental trade. The fish are either bred in captivity, or 
              captured from the wild.</li>
