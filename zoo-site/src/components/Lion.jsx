          A large, powerfully built cat that is second in sizeonly to the tiger; it is a famous apex
          predator. The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals
          since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer
          grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of
          Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the
          Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race
          that lives under strict protection in India's Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.

          The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary
          considerably between the sexes. The male's outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies
          between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or
          it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the
          throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are ery dark, almost
          black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate
          rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 6-7 feet long, excluding the 1-metre
          tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 370-500 pounds.

          <h2>FACTS</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>1. Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get 
            most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon. 
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>2. Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but 
            these generally disappear as they mature. 
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>3. Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight. 
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>4. They also hunt during storms. The noise, rain and/or wind make it harder for prey to see 
            and hear them, increasing their chances of a successful hunt.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>5. Lions run at a speed of up to 81kmph.
